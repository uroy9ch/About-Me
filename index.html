				<h2>About me:</h2>
				<p>Hey there, welcome to my <strong>"About Me"</strong> page.
					I guess the most interesting thing to know about me is that I like mostly things that go <em>fast!</em>
				
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Fast cars, fast boats, or a fast two wheeled vehicle interests me.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				
				I guess the reason why fast stuff interests me is because I'm an Industrial Designer at my core and fast stuff usually have a very dynamic and strong design purpose. I also get a kick out of strong, strategic Design as it applies to Interactive Design and brand awareness. Back in November 2014 I attended a brand experience installation sponsored and featuring Red Bull. They had artists create sculptures of their Red Bull cans. Not selling anything - just providing a brand experience to the general public - whether they were aware of the product or not. Just a smart and strategic approach to a marketing and brand awareness campaign.
